1) Explanation of Data Scraping Process
The data was collected through a Python-based web scraper utilizing BeautifulSoup to parse HTML and Requests to fetch web pages. Pagination was managed by incrementing page parameters in the URL, and specific data elements were identified through CSS selectors. The script handled exceptions for missing data and logged any inconsistencies for further review.

2) Key Finding
An intriguing finding from the data analysis showed that user engagement peaks at unexpected times, with higher activity during weekday evenings than weekends. This contradicts the common assumption that weekends are prime engagement periods.

3) Actionable Recommendation
Developers can leverage this insight by optimizing push notifications and content releases to align with weekday evening engagement peaks, potentially boosting user interaction and retention.
